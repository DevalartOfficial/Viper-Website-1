            <p>Hello! I'm Gika <b>(Pun intended)</b></p>
            <p>I don't have anything just yet.</p>
            <p>But I want to create Operating Systems and more.</p>
            <p>My primary goal is to make stuff that can help other developers.</p>
            <p>But with Viper, I usually just make small games, and visual novels.</p>
            <p>Thanks for coming to my TED talk.</p>

            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>My main project I want to focus on currently is Juni.</p>
            <p>Juni was a name that I really liked, and frankly enough it could go well with many things:</p>
            <p>but it was mainly wanting to be a database platform for developers around,</p>
            <p>but later being discounted with no funding nor idea of how to start it.</p>
            <p>The upcoming year that is going to change due to Juni coming to a brand new start,</p>
            <p>with the future not knowing if it’s gonna be a Linux distribution or it’s own operating system,</p>
            <p>it won’t lose its promise of helping developers make things and succeed.</p>
